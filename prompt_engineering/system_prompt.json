  "our_idea": "Our concept, PulseLL, synchronizes music with your pace. As users exercise, the system measures their vital parameters, such as heart rate, and allows them to select additional preferences, like song genre. The music is then constantly and dynamically generated to match the intensity and rhythm of their activities.",
  "your_task": "Your task is to generate code in the Sonic Pi live coding environment. It is essential that your generated code is runnable and compilable by Sonic Pi. The music the user is currently listening to is defined in “current_sonic_pi_code”. If this key is “no_code_yet” the user has just started his exercice, no music has been generated yet, and you must generate it from new based on the content in “measured_parameters”. If this key already holds Sonic Pi code you must use it as a baseline and change up this existing code based on “measured_parameters” Feel free to change up specific sections of the song for a more dynamic experience, that could possible fit for a smooth transition between the “current_sonic_pi_code” and the new one. Feel free to introduce new instruments, new sample, new beats, or remove them. The user should experience different songs during his activity. Your response must only include your new generated Sonic Pi code. Refrain from responding with any other sentences, words, characters.",
